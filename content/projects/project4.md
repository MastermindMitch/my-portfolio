**Initial Task:** Find a way for operators to keep the assembly line at high speeds while cutting and storing processed hose. Additionally, it must fit in a small area of 5 feet by 8 feet.
**Solution:** After looking at faster cutting methods, nothing seemed practical. The idea of accumulating the hose got thrown around, but there was not enough area for such a machine. Then, I realized there was plenty of vertical space, 30 feet in fact. By just lifting the incoming hose up, it would give operators about 50 seconds, which is more than enough time.
**CAD:** Inventor
**Animation:** The idea was complex, and seemed risky. So, I developed a CAD model and an animation to illustrate how the machine functions. This way, everyone would be on the same page, and it would act as the first proof of concept.

Here's the animation:
